# Create React App - Micro Front End Demo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Usage

- Keep all contextual/singleton packages (e.g. React) exact version locked with the host application

- Update `publicPath` in [`webpack-config.js`](https://github.com/sscotth/cramfedemo/blob/main/scripts/overrides/webpack-config.js) before deploying to production

- Pass user data as prop from the host application
